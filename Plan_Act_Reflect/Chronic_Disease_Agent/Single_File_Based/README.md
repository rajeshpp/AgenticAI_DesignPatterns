# Chronic Care (Single-file POC)

Overview
- This folder contains a standalone single-file implementation of the ChronicCare POC: `chronic_care.py`.

Run

```bash
cd "c:/Rajesh/R_D_Projects/AgenticAI/AgenticAI_DesignPatterns/Plan_Act_Reflect/Chronic_Disease_Agent/Single_File_Based"
python chronic_care.py
```

Notes
- This single-file version is meant for quick experimentation and demonstration. Use the multi-file POC when integrating with the LangGraph UI or when sharing components between scripts.
